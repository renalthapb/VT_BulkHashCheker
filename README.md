# VT_BulkHashCheker
This is a basic python script which can be used for static analysis of suspicious files in bulk. It utilises VirusTotal API V3 for checking the hashes. 
The VT_BulkHashChecker creates a table out of API's json output and writes it down to a file of your choice. 
Hashes can be fed via another csv or txt file. Due to 4 lookups/min limitation, there is a 20 seconds sleep command in between checking hashes.
